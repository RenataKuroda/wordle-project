# **Wordle Game**
Project submission for [General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly) Software Engineering Course flex mode (end of Unit 1), created only with Front-End Development. 

This project is a recreation of the popular game [Wordle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wordle) created by Josh Wardle. 

To check and play my version of Wordle go to this [link](https://renatakuroda.github.io/wordle-project/).

### **Instructions**

The aim of Wordle is to guess the correct five-letter word.
1. Use the keyboard to select your letters.
2. Click "Enter" to submit your word.
3. If your letter turns grey, that letter is not part of your word.
4. If your letter turns yellow, you have the correct letter but in the wrong position.
5. If your letter turns green, it's correct!
6. You have 6 attempts to find the correct word.
