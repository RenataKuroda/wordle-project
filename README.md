# Wordle - Project 1
Project submission for GA flex course end of Unit 1

To play the game go to this link https://renatakuroda.github.io/wordle-project/

The aim of Wordle is to guess the correct five-letter word.
Use the keyboard to select your letters.
Click "Enter" to submit your word.
If your letter doesn't change color, that letter is not part of your word.
If your letter turns yellow, you have the correct letter but in the wrong position.
If your letter turns green, it's correct!
You have 6 attempts to find the correct word.


Steps:
1 - create HTML with the basic structure of the game
2 - create JS to randomly get the words and check player inputs (score too?)
3 - create CSS to style the page
