# **Wordle Game**
Project submission for [General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly) Software Engineering Course flex mode (end of Unit 1), created only with Front-End Development. 

This project is a recreation of the popular game [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) created by [Josh Wardle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wordle). 

To check and play my version of Wordle go to this [link](https://renatakuroda.github.io/wordle-project/).

### **Instructions**

The aim of Wordle is to guess the correct five-letter word.
1. Use the keyboard to select your letters.
2. Click "Enter" to submit your word.
3. If your letter turns grey, that letter is not part of your word.
4. If your letter turns yellow, you have the correct letter but in the wrong position.
5. If your letter turns green, it's correct!
6. You have 6 attempts to find the correct word.

#### **The technical requirements for this project were:**

- Render a game in the browser
- Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files
- Be playable as a game with multiple turns or attempts
- Have logic for winning and losing the game (tell the player clearly when they win or lose, and stop the game)
- Use Javascript for DOM manipulation
- Deploy your game online, where the rest of the world can see it!

### **My step by step thoughts during project week**
1. Create HTML with the basic structure of the game
2. Create JS to randomly get the words and check player inputs
3. Create CSS to style the page
4. When game is working, spend time to QA (Quality Assurance)
5. Make it fun with sounds for winning and losing
